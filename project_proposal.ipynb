    "Tennis is a sport that is widely popular among players of all ages. On the dataset of the top 500 tennis players, we intend to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA). As a result of this analysis, we will gain insight into the characteristics of these players as well as explore potential relationships within the data. Tennis players exhibit a variety of playing styles, including differing backhand techniques. In this project, we aim to investigate whether the type of backhand (1-handed or 2-handed) has a significant effect on a player's ranking in the top 500 tennis players' dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the type of backhand technique (1-handed or 2-handed) influence a player's rank among the top 500 tennis players?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Dataset Description:***\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a CSV dataset containing information on the age, country, handedness, rank, backhand type, height, favorite playing surface, and years as a professional player for the top 500 tennis players.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis:***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate data import into the Notebook and data cleaning\n",
    "* Provide summary statistics and visualizations highlighting the distribution of player ranks for both 1-handed and 2-handed backhand players\n",
    "\n",
    "***Expected Outcomes and Significance:***\n",
    "\n",
    "* We expect that 2-handed backhand players will have a significant improvement on a player's rank because it is more consistent\n",
    "* Looking at the data, most of the tennis players use 2-handed backhand\n"
