    "**INTRODUCTION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be using a .csv dataset that has been created by \"The Ultimate Tennis Statistics\". This dataset contains information on the top 500 tennis players, including their age, height, country, handedness, backhand technique, current and best rank, seasons as a professional tennis player, in addition to a few other less relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tennis is a sport that is widely popular among players of all ages; most in which are striving to make it to the professional level of play. At this level, the top 500 players are known not only for the exceptional tennis playing skills, but also their wealth and prestige. This is why we have taken an interest in predicting a professional tennis player's total prize money based upon their age and best career ranking, using the k-nearest neighbors regression algorithm. \n",
